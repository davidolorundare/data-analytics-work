# Data Analytics work

Academic Project - Three data-analytics mini-projects done in a Data Science academic course.


## Project Overviews:

- **"KMEANS Chicago Food Inspection"** explored the use of the K-means clustering algorithm on a Chicago Food-inspection dataset. Clustering the data and answering useful queries about the nature of its content.

- **"Health Insurance Rates"** explored the use of Decision Trees and the evaluation of their performance based on the Gini and Entropy-based models, working with a health-insurance dataset and making classification predictions via the models.

- **"Customer Reviews"** explored customer reviews for different products manufactured by different vendors and sold by different retailers. Various data-analytics operations were performed and used to answer queries about customers behavior gleaned from insights on the review-data.

## Usage: 

Each project-folder contains a Jupyter notebook with python-code and analysis, as well as the accompanying dataset that was analyzed. Execution of any of the project, requires installation of [Jupyter/IPython notebook](http://jupyter.org/) . 
Installation details for Jupyter Notebook can be found [here.](http://jupyter.org/install.html)
